According to our records, you will be teaching the course <%= @course.name %> for the <%= @course.semester %> <%= @course.year %> semester.

<%= link_to "Configure my course", "http://rails.sv.cmu.edu" + configure_course_path(@course) %>


Why do we ask for this information?
Our students appreciate it since they often want to look at course materials before signing up for a course.
Our IT department appreciates it since they can help setup the IT resources you need before your course starts.
