<p>2/5/2010 - <b>Peer Evalution tool integrated!</b>- Russel Reed wrote the initial version of the Peer
Evaluation tool which allows faculty members to record student learning objectives.
Student teams can do a 360 peer evaluation. Faculty can quickly see who hasn't
done the evaluation. The tool also generates a draft report for each student.
This entire process used to be very tedious for the faculty since we had to both
setup Survey Monkey and manually generate the student reports.
